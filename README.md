# Fintech App Review Analysis

---
This repository analyzes user reviews of Ethiopian banking apps to uncover sentiment trends and key themes affecting user satisfaction. The workflow includes scraping reviews from the Google Play Store, preprocessing the text, performing sentiment analysis using NLP models, and extracting thematic insights through keyword clustering.

- **Python** 🐍
- **google-play-scraper** – Collect app reviews
- **pandas** – Data manipulation
- **transformers** – Sentiment classification (BERT)
- **scikit-learn** – TF-IDF vectorization
- **spaCy** – Text preprocessing and lemmatization
- **matplotlib / seaborn** – (Optional) Data visualization

## Features

- **Scraping Reviews:** Collects real reviews from the Google Play Store for:
  - Commercial Bank of Ethiopia
  - Bank of Abyssinia
  - Dashen Bank

- **Preprocessing:**
  - Emoji normalization (e.g., "😍" → "love")
  - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, optional lemmatization
  - Stopword filtering

- **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Uses `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` transformer model
  - Assigns each review a label: positive or negative
  - Results saved to `reviews_with_sentiment.csv`

- **Keyword Extraction:**
  - Identifies top keywords and bigrams per bank using TF-IDF
  - Saved to `keywords_per_bank.csv`

- **Thematic Clustering:**
  - Groups related keywords into themes such as:
